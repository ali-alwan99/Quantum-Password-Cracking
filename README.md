# Quantum-Password-Cracking

This project is a software program to simulate the impact of quantum computing on hashed passwords that was written in C++. The program accepts input strings/passwords and outputs the time to crack this password with a quantum computer vs a classical computer. 

The main threat to the security of symmetric and hashing algorithms is Grover's search algorithm. This algorithm utilizes quantum computing to search through an unstructured list of N entries, to find a particular entry in âˆšN searches.
